## Procedure

### Performing the Simulation:
 
The collision ball is used to demonstrate the elastic movement of the ball. The velocity and direction of the balls can be set by dragging the balls. The position of the balls can be changed by dragging the inner circle of the ball. The movement can be started by using the start button.

 

### Variable Region:
- The 'Coefficient of Restitution' slider is used for inelastic collision it can move from 0 to 1.
- The 'Mass' slider helps to change the mass values for object A and object B.
- The 'Show Center of Mass' check box help to enable and disable the center of mass of the objects.
- The 'Play' and 'Pause' buttons are used to reset and pause the movement of the ball.
 

### Measurement Region:

Shows the velocity and kinetic energy of the Objects A and B.
