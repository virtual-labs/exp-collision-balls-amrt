      "question": "A very heavy object moving with velocity v collides head-on with a very light object moving with velocity -v. The collision is elastic, and there is no friction. The heavy object barely slows down. What is the speed of the light object after the collision?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "nearly v",
        "b": "nearly 3v",
        "c": "nearly infinite",

      "question": "Two cars collide in a completely inelastic collision at a North-South East-West intersection. The skid marks point roughly northwest. Concerning the initial directions of the two cars, this tells you that one driver was traveling:",

        "a": "West: the other driver was travelling the south",
        "b": "East:the other driver was travelling the south",
